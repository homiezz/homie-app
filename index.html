                        First of all, we tried to identify a problem that is quite present in our lives. None of the
                        team
                        members was born in the city where we live, so we became tenants. We discussed different topics
                        that
                        represented an inconvenience for us, and found that a very common problem was the communication
                        with
                        the owner of the apartment we live in, the way owners usually handle the documents and bills,
                        and
                        the lack of knowledge we had about the owner’s history before we moved in.

                    <div class="problem-content">
                        Considering the problem we identified, we thought about Homie, our companion for renting and
                        managing bills stress-free. Homie is a web(/mobile) application that facilitates the
                        communication
                        between landlords and tenants and simplifies the process of managing bills enabling users to
                        monitor
                        rent, utility, and payments. Furthermore, app users will have a history and can receive reviews
                        from
                        people they have interacted with in the past.

            <div class="one-row-content">
                To connect with possible customers, we'll have conversations with people looking for new places to live
                or
                those seeking to generate passive income from their properties. Engaging in open dialogues with these
                individuals will be highly valuable in capturing their unique habits, understanding their problems and
                identifying potential solutions. <br />
                We'll also participate in online groups and communities on platforms like Facebook, where renters and
                landlords share their experiences and concerns. This approach will help us reach a larger audience and
                gather feedback through online surveys. <br />
                To attract people interested in our idea, we'll have a sign-up option for email updates on our landing
                page.
                We'll use these emails to keep them informed about what we offer. Finally, we'll be active on social
                media
                to increase our visibility and popularity, which will help us build a strong network in the real estate
                industry. <br />
                In summary, by talking to both renters and property owners, using online communities, email marketing,
                and
                social media, we aim to learn about their specific needs and general preferences, which will allow us to
                tailor our services effectively and to realize who our customers really are. <br />

                acquaintances and others we didn't know at all who were happy to help us after posting on their online
                community. <br /> <br />

                    the
                    discussion, we prepared a set of 3 questions:

                How did it affect our product

            <div class="one-row-content">
                From our perspective, the primary challenge revolved around the communication between landlords and
                tenants,
                including how bills were sent, payments were made, and emergency situations were addressed. We initially
                assumed that finding rental properties was straightforward, given the abundance of online platforms for
                property listings.<br />
                However, during our discussions, we realized that the actual interaction between landlords and tenants
                was
                quite minimal. On average, managing rent, along with all associated communication, consumed only 15
                minutes
                to 2 hours per month. Landlords had developed their own methods for handling bills and were comfortable
                with
                their processes. The common issue they faced was related to reminders for consumption data or
                payments.<br />
                One significant aspect missing from the equation was a structured system for feedback records. It was
                challenging to determine from various social media groups if a tenant had failed to pay their bills, and
                even harder to identify trustworthy landlords. Additionally, there was a lack of effective search
                filtering,
                making it difficult for users to find specific rental properties, such as pet-friendly options or
                landlords
                willing to provide written contracts.<br />
                After talking with more individuals, we have significantly narrowed down the target audience, reaching
                to
                landlords and tenants seeking to form a detailed impression of the people they are considering for
                rental
                collaboration and aiming to streamline their interactions with a one-click approach. <br /><br />

                    <p>Based on the interview we conducted with one of our potential customers, we deduced that, due to
                        the lack of strong feedback, he experienced the displeasure of encountering cockroaches during
                        one of his apartment visits. Additionally, he faced the hassle of toggling between real estate
                        agents who would mislead him into viewing an apartment not in line with his requirements and
                        then stop responding to messages. This reinforced our assumption that our solution should
                        prioritize feedback from other tenants regarding an apartment, as well as feedback from
                        landlords towards the tenants, and vice versa.</p>

                    <p>From another interview, Ruxi, told us that she preferred searching for an apartment on a Facebook
                        group, because she did not want to deal with real estate agents, who can be deceiving about
                        their descriptions of the flats since their end goal is to make a profit. Another strong point,
                        which further validated our idea, is that she looked for feedback from former tenants that lived
                        in the apartment she wanted to rent. She pointed out that aspects like: "Did someone else rented
                        this place before?", the interaction with the landlord, how the bills were paid, which currency
                        they used for the rent, were some of the things she wanted to know beforehand. All of this is
                        leading us to the conclusion that the problem we identified is real and impacting people's
                        lives, which means they could all benefit from our solution.</p>

                        communicate directly with each other. This particular landlord said he had a great experience
                        with his first tenant, however, we could not miss the use of the word "lucky" on more than one
                        occasion, more specifically how lucky he was to have found this particular tenant. He also
                        shared a story in which another landlord was not so fortunate, thus emphasizing that a strong
                        feedback could help tenants with great reviews to find a flat faster and landlords to pick the

                            <li>To optimize the website for mobile devices, the company could use a responsive design
                                that adapts to different screen sizes and improves the readability and usability of the
                                content.</li>
                            <li>To reduce the dead clicks on the logo and the navbar, the company could make them more
                                interactive and functional, such as linking the logo to the homepage and adding a menu
                                icon or a dropdown list to the navbar.</li>
                            <li>To increase the conversions and the leads, the company could showcase the benefits and
                                the features of the service more prominently on the page, and use clear and compelling
                                calls to action that encourage users to sign up, log in, or send an email.</li>
